# Google Homepage

I will be making a replica of google's homepage with along with user [xenozuron](https://github.com/xenozuron). We made this code from scratch to teach ourselves more about HTML and CSS. 

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
